run git.sh in your projects folder
now you have a new folder in the folder
if you want to update your version, use git pull
if you want to commit changes, first pull to make sure no changes were made during that time
Then:
git add .
git commit -m"Message for what youve changed"
git push

Likely, youll have to use some commands that require inputting a github username and password if youre looking to contribute this way, if its not worth it just send it to me and ill handle version control
